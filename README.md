# Arrhythmia Detection using SVM and XGBoost

This project uses machine learning to detect arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat) from ECG data. It applies two models:

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **XGBoost**

The goal is to classify heartbeats as normal or abnormal.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- xgboost

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
